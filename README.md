# Bridge mental visualization

**Main idea**: track what you know about a bridge game step by step. You should be able to learn how to use the knowlage about the kards. Your goal is to keep it all in your had - eventually :) 

**How to use**

![alt text](https://github.com/LucjanJanowski/bridge_mental_visualization/screen.png?raw=true)

For each player you have range of pints which you predict. You can put any number of cards (traditionally by x). If you know the card you can change x to the value. Possible values are digits 2-9, T, J, Q, K, A. If a card was played you can clikc it. It will change to green. 

**Example**

I play on S with cards:
AK843
Q562
`-
JT98

N starts and I see bidding $\auction{,,,1s,2d}$
